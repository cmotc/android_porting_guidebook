How to use dmesg to examine your hardware
=========================================
Sometimes you will need to import a repository or object file which applies to a
specific piece of hardware on your device, and sometimes, you won't even have 
access to the name of that piece of hardware. 

In this case, the closest to a universal means to discern what this hardware is
to use dmesg, the driver messaging system. In order to do this you will need to
connect to the device via "adb shell" or use the Terminal Emulator or ConnectBot
App, both of which are available in F-Droid and the Google Play Store.
