Android Porting Guidebook
=========================
The aim of this book is to document all of the common errors one encounters in
the process of compiling an Open-Source Android ROM for a phone that is not
supported by the ROM's official development team, in order to encourage wider
support for custom ROM's on a wider variety of phones, including budget 
offerings.

Devices used during the composition of this book include, but are not limited,
the Qualcomm ZTE Force(hayes, aurora), the Samsung Galaxy Centura
(SCH-S738YBATFN), and the LGE Optimus Logic(LG-L35G).
